<function>
    <description>
Returns a list of regular expression matches of `regex` on `string`.

Note that the result will be a LIST. The first item contains the entire string value. All other elements are matching groups.
`regex` must always match the entire string value.

Note that the escape character "\" needs to be escaped.

Optionally `timeout` can be provided in milliseconds, the default value is 5000 milliseconds. Set `timeout` to zero to let the function run without timeout. This should only be altered when dealing with large source documents. The `timeout` is there to protect the system from hanging on invalid expressions.

See the regular expressions page for more about regular expression support in Xill IDE.
