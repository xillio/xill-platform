Converts a given date to a value with the provided `format`.

The `format` parameter can be composed using various symbols. The most commonly used symbols are listed in the table below. The default format is: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".

| Symbol | Meaning                  | Presentation  | Example                |
| ------ | --------                 | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| u/y    | year                     | year          | 2004; 04               |
| Q/q    | quarter-of-year          | number/text   | 3; 03; Q3; 3rd quarter |
| M/L    | month-of-year            | number/text   | 7; 07; Jul; July; J    |
| d      | day-of-month             | number        | 10                     |
| E      | day-of-week              | text          | Tue; Tuesday; T        |
| H      | hour-of-day              | number        | 14                     |
| m      | minute-of-hour           | number        | 55                     |
| s      | second-of-minute         | number        | 30                     |
| a      | am/pm                    | text          | PM;                    |
| '      | escape for text ('text') | delimiter     |                        |
| ''     | literal '                | literal       | '                      |

The Symbol column in the table lists the symbols that may directly be used in the `format` parameter. The way the value that corresponds to the symbol is represented, depends on the number of characters used in the symbol. For example: using "M" would result in "8", while "MM" results in "08" and "MMM" results in "Aug". A more thorough description of how these values are represented and what other options are available, can be found in [Java's pattern definition](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns).

The `format` parameter can also include other characters that are not used for representing date values (except for: ',[,],#,{,}). For example: using "HH.mm" results in "16.14".
Text can be shown by putting single quotation marks around it. For example: "'Current Year: 'YYYY" results in "Current Year: 2016".

        <example title="Usage">
            <header>Printing the formatted current datetime.</header>
            <code>
use System, Date;
var date = Date.now();
System.print(Date.format(date));
            </code>
            <header>A more complex format</header>
            <code>
use System, Date;
var date = Date.now();
var format = Date.format(date, "QQQ:yyyy E dd MMMM H'h'mm\"ss''");
System.print(format);
// Results in the form:
// "Q1:2016 Thu 31 March 10h59"39'"
