<function>
    <description>
Returns a new string based on `text` in which occurrences of the string `needle` have been replaced by the string `replacement`.

If the optional parameter `replaceall` is set to `false`, the routine will only replace the first occurrence of `needle` (defaults to `true`).
Note that `needle` is by default interpreted as a regex pattern, so all special regex characters have to be escaped when used as a literal.
Also in `replacement` you can use the capture groups from `needle` as "$1", "$2", etc.
To use a literal "$" in `replacement`, you need to escape it like this: "\$".
Set `useregex` to `false` to have the function treat `needle` and `replacement` as regular text.

Optionally a timeout can be provided in seconds, the default value is 5 seconds.
Set `timeout` to zero to let the function run without timeout. This should only be altered when dealing with large source documents.
See the Regular Expressions page for more about Regular Expression support in Xill IDE.
